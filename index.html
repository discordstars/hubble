                            After discovering that other galaxies exist, he also created a way to
                            classify galaxies, called the <strong>Galaxy morphological classification</strong>.

                            This system was of course later expanded upon, but layed the foundations for the
                            modern galaxy classification and has helped modern physicists understand the
                            Universe.

                            Edwin Hubble's work proved to astronomers that there are
                            other galaxies outside of the milky way. At the time of the
                            completion of the <strong>Hooker Telescope</strong>, the widely-accepted view
                            of the Universe was that it consisted only of the Milky Way
                            Galaxy.

                        <li>
                            Using this telescope, he used the methods he knew to find
                            and use <strong>Cepheid variables</strong> &mdash; stars that pulsate at
                            a frequent interval and can be used to determine the distance
                            of surrounding objects. Using these stars, he proved that some
                            nebulae observed by astronomers were simply too far away to be
                            part of our own galaxy.

                            His discovery is seen as one of the most important discoveries in Astrophysics,
                            and has lead to a much clearer understanding of the universe and changed the way
                            people at the time and people now see the Universe.

                            Edwin Hubble devised what is now known as the <strong>Hubble-Lema√Ætre law</strong> &mdash;
                            a law that states that galaxies are moving away from Earth (or any point in space) at
                            velocities relative to their distances (farther away = faster recession velocity).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The equation <code>v = H<sub>0</sub>&middot;D</code> uses something called the
                            <strong>Hubble constant</strong>, a value that changes over time and gives the
                            velocity of recession of a galaxy at any distance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Hubble constant is currently valued as <code>70(kms<sup>-1</sup>)Mpc<sup>-1</sup></code>
                            however the SI unit for the value of <code>H<sub>0</sub></code> is <code>s<sup>-1</sup></code>.

                            Edwin Hubble was a physicist born in November, 1889, and pioneered the field of
                            Astrophysics and equally pioneered for it to be recognised as a field of physics
                            by the Nobel prize committee.

                            He was born in Marshfield, Missouri and studied at the University of Chicago and
                            The Queen's College, although he initially studied law as his father wanted him
                            to work in the same career as him.
